    abstract = "{Identifying new therapeutic effects for the approved drugs is beneficial for effectively reducing the drug development cost and time. Most of the recent computational methods concentrate on exploiting multiple kinds of information about drugs and disease to predict the candidate associations between drugs and diseases. However, the drug and disease nodes have neighboring topologies with multiple scales, and the previous methods did not fully exploit and deeply integrate these topologies.We present a prediction method, multi-scale topology learning for drug-disease (MTRD), to integrate and learn multi-scale neighboring topologies and the attributes of a pair of drug and disease nodes. First, for multiple kinds of drug similarities, multiple drug–disease heterogenous networks are constructed respectively to integrate the similarities and associations related to drugs and diseases. Moreover, each heterogenous network has its specific topology structure, which is helpful for learning the corresponding specific topology representation. We formulate the topology embeddings for each drug node and disease node by random walking on each heterogeneous network, and the embeddings cover the neighboring topologies with different scopes. Because the multi-scale topology embeddings have context relationships, we construct Bi-directional long short-term memory-based module to encode these embeddings and their relationships and learn the neighboring topology representation. We also design the attention mechanisms at feature level and at scale level to obtain the more informative pairwise features and topology embeddings. A module based on multi-layer convolutional networks is constructed to learn the representative attributes of the drug–disease node pair according to their related similarity and association information. Comprehensive experimental results indicate that MTRD achieves the superior performance than several state-of-the-art methods for predicting drug–disease associations. MTRD also retrieves more actual drug–disease associations in the top-ranked candidates of the prediction result. Case studies on five drugs further demonstrate MTRD’s ability in discovering the potential candidate diseases for the interested drugs.}",

	abstract = {Extraction and integration of semantic connections, spatial relations and dependencies are critical in volumetric image segmentation. This is a challenging issue, especially when there are long-distance objects with close semantic relations and neighboring objects with indistinct boundaries. We propose a novel dynamic graph convolution (DGC) autoencoder with node-attribute-wise attention (NodeAttri-Attention) for relation inference and reasoning, with applications on kidney and tumor segmentation from computerized tomography (CT) volumes. We first introduce a new graph construction strategy for 3D volumetric image data, where graph node attributes and connections represent topological relations and high-level correlations. Then NodeAttri-Attention mechanism is proposed to obtain attention-enhanced node attributes by discriminating adaptive contributions of various features. Finally, the DGC strategy is designed to learn and integrate the complex and underlying correlations across image regions. Our DGC dynamically updates graph topology and node attributes as the graph convolutional layer gradually deepens. Experimental results and ablation studies demonstrated the effectiveness of each of our major innovations in NodeAttri-Attention DGC, especially when objects are with weak boundaries, irregular shapes, and various sizes. The improved segmentation results of embedding NodeAttri-Attention DGC to different segmentation backbones show the generality of DGC autoencoder.},
